Field_specification forms still needing updating for tables:

courses
proctors
proffessors
schedules
students
students_courses
students_tests
testCenters
days
tests

To Implementation:

available seats constraint - still needs implementation. Requires a query, and a php function,
                   should be written in either professor_page_functions. 
                   
OperatingHours constraint- need to fix time constraints so that lunch (12-1), saturday and sunday 
                 are not allowed. May require not using "time" as the input type. 
                 
Proctor Scheduleing - We should have a calander system for proctor schedueling, so that 
              it can be more flexible, and not just repeating every week. Other 
              teams had this so we ought to have it. 
              
Filters - we should have buttons able to filter the test information being 
          displayed on the proctors and professors pages.
