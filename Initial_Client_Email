ACME Proctoring Services,

Heart Database Design would like to thank you for enlisting our services for your database overhaul. Before designing your new database, we will need some information regarding ACME's current system. Feel free to elaborate in any answers to the following questions.

What professor data is required in order to allow them to schedule tests?

What student data is required in order for them to take tests?

Please provide a form that professors use to schedule a test.

Please provide a screenshot of what a given day's testing schedule looks like for a user.

Please provide any other screenshot samples from your application that your users interact with.

Have professors extended any complaints with regards to scheduling or rescheduling tests?

How far in advance must scheduling, rescheduling, and cancelling tests take place?



Thank you for taking time to assist us with our design process.
